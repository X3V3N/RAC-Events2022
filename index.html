        <h3>BUS OF HOPE CANCER AWARENESS</h3>
        <br>
        Cancer is a disease in which some of the body's cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply to form new cells as the body needs them. When this orderly process breaks down, and abnormal or damaged cells grow and multiply when they should not, the formation of tumours may take place. Tumours can be canerous.
        <br><br>
        An estimated two-thirds of all cancers are preventable and yet two-thirds of all cancer patients are not cured. This is a major cause for concern.
        <br><br>
        Bus of Hope is an event that was conducted in order to raise awareness about this disease.
